# Churn-solution
This project provides a real solution for companies which suffer from the churn:Nowadays, many entrepreneurs have tended to use the ML model to detect client with bad behavior, in order to give them new offers and opportunities to convince not leaving. This act appears simple and worth it, but it can cost much resource without getting advantages. So choosing a good strategy to give offers is so important as it can lead to a successful process.

### Prerequisites
-machine learning model (tree solution)

-some basics of python
```
pandas library
```
The most importent issue to succesfuly upload this algorithm and to have a good result.You have to correctly evaluate 
features.
A company has to invest to improve customer behavior and each offer  has of course a cost.So in my case features are:
```
number-of-calls:the number of calls for a user
number-of-neighbors:other customer whom  the actuel customer communicate with
flag-data:is customer using data offers
```

Remarques:
```
To increase number-of-calls with one unit company should invest 3$.
```
```
If increasing or decreasing such beahavior is impossible putting very high cost is worth it.
```
```
In the case of categorical variable. Put the cost of changing varaible's category in the increasing field.
```
